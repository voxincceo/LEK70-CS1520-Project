			of Pittsburgh studying Computer Engineering. You can find me on LinkedIn to get a better understanding
			of my background and experience. I look forward to serving you!</div>

			<div class="panel-heading"><h4>Why did we get started?</h4></div>
			<div class="panel-body">In high school, I did not have the money to afford new devices like the iPhone, a
				Playstation 3, or a personal laptop. So I figured, why not by a much cheaper broken device and try 
				to fix it? That's exactly what I did in order to purchase my first PS3. From there, I began to flip
				many different kinds of electronic devices on the internet. Eventually, my classmates would come to 
				me looking for a quick fix on their devices as well. Now, today, I offer my services to anyone who needs
				them, with over 6 years of experience.</div>
